## About

With our Shopware app you can add a conversion header to your store. The conversion header is a kind of header area that is displayed at the top of the store and presents important information and offers to the user directly when they enter the store. For example, this can be a special offer, a coupon code or an important notification. Due to its prominent placement in the header area, the conversion header is particularly visible and can help draw users' attention to important content, thus increasing your conversion rate.
